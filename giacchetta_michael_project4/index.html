			<h2>What is Frisbee Golf?</h2>

			<p id="content"><Strong>Disc Golf</strong>, (as defined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_golf">Wikipedia</a>) also known as Frolf, Folf, Frisbee disc or <em>Frisbee Golf</em>, is a flying disc game, as well as a precision and accuracy sport, in which individual players throw a flying disc at a target. According to Paul Ince of the Professional Disc Golf Association, <q>the object of the game is to traverse a course from beginning to end in the fewest number of throws of the disc.</q> In just 8 years (2000-2008), the number of disc golf courses doubled. The game is played in about 40 countries around the world.</p>

			<p>Disc golf is played much like traditional golf. Instead of a ball and clubs, however, players use a flying disc, or Frisbee®. The sport was formalized in the 1970's, and shares with "ball golf" the object of completing each hole in the fewest strokes (or, in the case of disc golf, fewest throws). A golf disc is thrown from a tee area to a target which is the "hole". The hole can be one of a number of disc golf targets; the most common is called a Pole Hole® an elevated metal basket. As a player progresses down the fairway, he or she must make each consecutive throw from the spot where the previous throw has landed. The trees, shrubs, and terrain changes located in and around the fairways provide challenging obstacles for the golfer. Finally, the "putt" lands in the basket and the hole is completed. Disc golf shares the same joys and frustrations of traditional golf, whether it's sinking a long putt or hitting a tree halfway down the fairway. There are few differences, though. Disc golf rarely requires a greens fee, you probably won't need to rent a cart, and you never get stuck with a bad "tee time." It is designed to be enjoyed by people of all ages, male and female, regardless of economic status.</p>

			<p>If you are looking to get serious about you Frisbee Golf game check out the Professional Disc Golf Association at <a href="http://www.pdga.com">www.pdga.com</a>.

The sport of disc golf is becoming every bit as professional as its older brother the PGA and its traditional ball and club golf.
